<h3>Purchasing Gift Vouchers.</h3>
<p>Gift Vouchers are purchased just like any other item in our store. You can
  pay for them using the stores standard payment method(s).
  Once purchased the value of the Gift Voucher will be added to your own personal
  Gift Voucher Account. If you have funds in your Gift Voucher Account, you will
  notice that the amount now shows in he Shopping Cart box, and also provides a
  link to a page where you can send the Gift Voucher to some one via email.</p>

<h4>How to Send Gift Vouchers.</h4>
<p>To send a Gift Voucher you need to go to our Send Gift Voucher Page. You can
  find the link to this page in the Shopping Cart Box in the right hand column of
  each page.
  When you send a Gift Voucher, you need to sepcify the following.
  The name of the person you are sending the Gift Voucher too.
  The email address of the person you are sending the Gift Voucher too.
  The amount you want to send. (Note you don\'t have to send the full amount that
  is in your Gift Voucher Account.)

  Please ensure that you have entered all of the information correctly, although
  you will be given the opportunity to change this as much as you want before
  the email is actually sent.</p>

<h4>Buying with Gift Vouchers.</h4>
  <p>If you have funds in your Gift Voucher Account, you can use those funds to
  purchase other items in out store. At the checkout stage, an extra box will
  appear. Ticking this box will apply those funds in your Gift Voucher Account.

  your purchase the balance will bel left in you Gift Voucher Account for the
